### Brain Tumor Classification Using KNN
## Project Overview
# This project is a supervised machine learning application that detects the presence of a brain tumor from MRI images. The model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm and deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive instant predictions.

## Features
# MRI Image Upload via Web Interface
# Automatic Image Preprocessing
# Tumor / No Tumor Prediction

## Techstack
# Python
# OpenCV
# NumPy
# Scikit-learn
# Streamlit

## Dataset

# The dataset consists of brain MRI images categorized into:
# - Tumor
# - No Tumor
