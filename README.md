# Brain Tumor Classification Using KNN
## Project Overview
### This project is a supervised machine learning application that detects the presence of a brain tumor from MRI images. The model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm and deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive instant predictions.

## Features :
### MRI Image Upload via Web Interface
### Automatic Image Preprocessing
### Tumor / No Tumor Prediction

## Techstack :
### Python
### OpenCV
### NumPy
### Scikit-learn
### Streamlit

## Dataset :

### The dataset consists of brain MRI images categorized into:
### - Tumor
### - No Tumor
